# My GitHub Page : [My study Journal](https://intrastella.github.io/)

## Content of my Blog:

I publish articles about concepts that interest me in the realm of machine learning and some fields of mathematics.
In addition, I will publish every other week a topic from my studies (mathematics). 


## How I have setup my GitHub page:

- Jekyll to create article fast and easy
- Some modified LIQUID functions
- Javascript classes and functions for extra features
- Implemented my own comment section that has a hidden Google form that is connected to a spreadsheet
- With Apps Script I build a JSON Rest API in that way I have a dynamic website
- Automated process to implement Latex into my posts


## TODO

- Make "markers", "plus button" responsive to screen size 
- "html font weight changes from laptop to laptop" 
- "topic" page for 3 max width sizes
