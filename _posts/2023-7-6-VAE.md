\
\

This article was created for those who would like to understand more about the mathematical reasoning behind a model such as VAE. For this purpose I am introducing a range of different concepts in statistics
that help understand the decision making of this paper's  authors. I marked them with (in short) to indicate that they are only a short summery of relevant mathematical statements for this post.
If you have any questions or suggestions  regarding this article feel free to leave a comment.

If you are keen to know more details about each topic I can suggest




## 2. Introduction

Applications of such a model is amongst others data representation, generating artificial data and image super-resolution.
As we know from a standard AE an encoder tries to find the most relevant features of observed data and captures this information in a feature vector and the decoder has to reconstruct the original data. Hence, 
the architecture of a standard AE can be used for data representation. If we sample some features from a latent variable and feed that to the decoder we could use the decoder  for generating artificial data.
Those characteristics make an AE a useful basic structure for these goals.

Here is an explanatory illustration that shows the model design:

In a VAE, the encoder's task is to describe the distributions of those features based on the data we observed. Whereas during inference, just the decoder will be used as a generator, during training, 
the entire model will be treated as a generator model. From that perspective, sampled values from the latent variable are generated from an unknown prior distribution. Hence, we would like to construct a model based on that perspective.

***The goal of this model is to find out from which distribution family these latent variables are drawn. In addition, we would like to increase the likelihood that such a latent distribution originated from our observed data.***

Throughout this article I assume that the data is iid. by some random process.

Let's first formulate that mathematically:
