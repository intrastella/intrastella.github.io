title: Mathematical Explanation â€“ Variational Auto-Encoder
---

This article was created for those who would like to understand more about the mathematical reasoning behind a model such as VAE. For this purpose I am introducing a range of different concepts in statistics
that help understand the decision making of this paper's  authors. I marked them with (in short) to indicate that they are only a short summery of relevant mathematical statements for this post.
If you have any questions or suggestions  regarding this article feel free to leave a comment.
