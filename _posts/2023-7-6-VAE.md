start: This article was created for those who would like to understand more about the mathematical reasoning behind a model such as VAE. For this purpose I am introducing a range of different concepts in statistics that help understand the decision-making of this paper's authors. I sum- marized only the most relevant mathematical statements for this post of each topic. To make a VAE more comprehensive I emphasized 
  on the modeling of it and core concepts to computationally realize it. Aditionally, I used day-to-day examples and visualisations that help building an intuition. If you have any questions or suggestions regarding this topic feel free to contact me.

{% include chapter.html name="Introduction" %}

This article elaborates on relevant concepts and approaches mentioned in the paper [Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes by Diederik P. Kingma, Max Welling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114.pdf).

<br/>

To understand the architecture of a VAE, a generator, and its mathematical model, we will need to determine first the goal of such a model type and its 
relationship to a discriminator. <br/>
With a discriminative model we want to make a prediction about an attribute based on various observations. Such a model tries to learn a mapping from that data 
to this attribute. To do so it tries to extract features of these observations that has the highest correlation with that attribute.

<br/>

Imagine, when I was a little child, I always got upset when my mom bought apples that had some brown spots.
She always answered: "No, they are good! Those are just some injuries." 
Sure, as if apples are like humans and could have "injuries" - you are just trying to make these cheap apples palatable, was my response back then.
Indeed, my mom was right, injuries of the apples skin exposes its tissue to oxygen that turns polyphenol (a micronutrient in the apple) into melanin. 

Coming back to our problem, we could collect observations, like skin color of an apple and its surface structure and so on, to make a prediction whether an apple is rotten or not.
And, even though my mom was right, brown spots are usually a good indication since some infecting spores of fungi that occur in rotten apples create a brown coloration.
A discriminator would be able to find that correlation, like me as a child. 

<br/> Unfortunately, such a model will eliminate also apples that are healthy to consume but are just a bit damaged.
Because of those instances, a model that can learn the causal relationship is of course more precise. 
To achieve that it would have to learn the generating process of decaying apples. {% include linking_source.html no="1" %}

{% include highlights.html 
content_txt="The goal after training is that such a generator creates **realistic data**, 
here a realistic example of an apple, therefore it needs to be able to understand what realistic means.
"%}

If we abstract this case, we could say that an attribute like the level of decay is just another feature that describes an object.
From that perspective every object is a state of a collection of features or call it attributes if you like.

Based on my observations and assumptions I did as a child I would have described such an apple by the following states of features:
- mainly red colored
- brown spots
- shiny skin
- *decomposed*
- etc.

{% include highlights.html 
content_txt="A trained generator for this application should 'understand' that the occurrence of having a shiny skin and being decomposed at the same time is highly unlikely.
In other words, a generator should /c/uncover how all the features that describe an object are jointly distributed/c/.
"%} 

<br>
The idea of generating realistic data can be expanded:

Let's say we have a trained generator at hand that understands the generating process of building sentences. That means it understands that there is first an idea that is 
afterwards expressed in a sentence. But an idea exists within a context. So how would we incorporate such a context? 
An intuitive approach would be to say: Given we speak about rotten fruits and I asked "Is this apple healthy to consume?" what would be a realistic response? 
Such a contextual information is thereby incorporated by conditioning the input data on it.

<br/>

Another important goal of training a generator is data completion. For instance, image resolution. For this purpose we need to transform the generator also into a conditional generator.
It generates data depending on the state of some additional data, here a low-resolution image. {% include linking_source.html no="4" %}

<br/>

Often in ML we encounter the problem of having just a very small dataset that is labelled. A generator can also help in those instances. For this purpose you let a deterministic model
train parallel to the generator. The labels are then treated like features, such that the discriminative model has to predict the labels as features but also other useful descriptive features.
Based on these predicted labels and features the generator has to reconstruct the original data. {% include linking_source.html no="5" %}

<br/>

{% include highlights.html 
content_txt="In summary, such a model should be used for **semi-supervised learning**, **data completion** and **generating realistic data**. And it does so by learning
the joint distribution of all features."%}

### REMARK

Every illustration was designed by me and every mathematical statement was (re)formulated and every calculation was done by me. Obviously these 
statements and calculations are backed up by the sources I have mentioned in the last chapter and my mathematical background.

<br/>

### NOTATION

I usually use capital letters to denote random variables or vectors and *f*  to denote probability density functions compared to *p* for 
probability mass functions. Since the authors of the VAE paper chose to use small letters for random variables and vectors and *p* for both probability density and mass 
function I decided to stick with that notation.

{% include highlights.html 
content_txt="Some of you may know that /c/finding a good data representation/c/, that is extracting more expressive features of the data, will increase the chances 
of training a good discriminator. Typical methods include the use of an auto-encoder or principal component analysis which finds a representation of the data where each feature is uncorrelated.
A new representation of a datapoint is called **latent feature vector**. The word, latent, stems from the fact that the space of latent features in a DL model for 
data representation is hidden from us.

On the left you can see a generators output for creating handwritten numbers.
By varying the feature values we will obtain different results as you can see on the left image.

<br/>

Let's first formulate that mathematically:

{% include highlights.html

or we made an initial assumption about its distribution we can use Bayesian inference to /c/update prior distribution by the true posterior/c/." 
%}

<br>

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-7-6-VAE/eq4.png)

<br/>
The product of the likelihood and prior is our model. At this point we are just missing the evidence, p(x). We can obtain it by marginalizing it from the joint distribution as we will later see.
This update principle will set up the architecture and mechanism of a VAE.

%}

The following illustration captures this mechanism:

{% include image.html url="/images/2023-7-6-VAE/diag1.png" text="This diagram illustrates assignments of distributions." %}

<br/>
<br>

To understand the learning process for this model I will need to introduce you to the concept of a family of densities:

Equation (2) is by itself not computable in our case because it involves calculating log(p(x)). The following calculation will show that:

<br/>

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-7-6-VAE/eq10.png)

<br/>

{% include chapter.html name="The Evidence Lower Bound" %}

<br/>

Even though the Kullback-Leibner Divergence is not computable we can use it after applying some tweaks.

<br/>

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-7-6-VAE/eq11.png)

<br/>

By adding the log(p(x)) term to the Kullback-Leibner Divergence we eliminate log(p(x)) from our objective.
With some further transformations we obtain an objective that we can use for our model.

<br/>

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-7-6-VAE/eq12.png)

<br/>

With that new expression we only have to work with the prior, likelihood and posterior.
From the following property we can see the reason why it is called the evidence lower bound.

<br/>

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-7-6-VAE/eq13.png)

<br/>

Below you can find an animated example where p is a normal density function and q a gamma density function. The gamma 
distribution is very flexible and, hence, useful to derive many different distributions like the chi-square, exponential and beta.
The plot on top is the graph of the ELBO and below a plot of p and q with varying values for its parameters. 
The maximum of log(p) is zero for every density and since the ELBO is bounded from above by log(p) the ELBO is therefore
bounded by zero from above.

{% include highlights.html

<br/>

<br/>

{% include chapter.html name="The gradient problem" %}

After constructing our loss function we need to find a method to train our model. Kingma and Welling intend to use stochastic gradient decent, which 
is a noisy estimation of the true gradient. This method requires calculating the gradient which leads us to two problems:

<br/>

{% include highlights.html 
content_txt="I) This model needs to sample latent values from z, a random vector, and feed it to the decoder. During **backpropagation** the model will encounter the 
issue that /c/z cannot be deterministically expressed/c/ and thereby cannot calculate the gradient. There are two main approaches, Black-Box Variational Inference (BBVI) and the Reparameterization
Trick, to overcome this learning obstacle."%}


{% include res_img.html url="/images/2023-7-6-VAE/backprop.png" %}


{% include highlights.html 
content_txt="II) Whereas the Kullback-Leibner Divergence is analytically tractable - the reconstruction error is most often not. This creates of course an issue when
the model needs to calculate the gradient of it. A typical solution would be to use **Monte Carlo estimates**."%}

<br>

{% include highlights.html 
content_txt="/c/The gradient estimates of BBVI typically suffer from high variance/c/ and that would require using a very small learning rate which lead to slow convergence. 
Therefore, the second approach is recommended. This method typically needs only one Monte Carlo sample to estimate a noisy gradient. "%}

<br/>

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/separator.png)

<br>


{% include chapter.html name="Reparameterization Trick" %}

<br/>

{% include highlights.html 
content_txt="
The idea is to find a /c/deterministic expression of the random vector, z/c/. This is achieved by constructing a **differentiable bijection** 
between z and a random noise, ε, that does not
depend on the variational parameters.
"%}

<br/>

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-7-6-VAE/eq15.png)

<br/>

As you might have noticed g depends not only on the random noise, ε, but also on x. That is because we sample z from ``q(z|x)``. 
Then the Reparameterization Trick will give us the following identity:

<br/>

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-7-6-VAE/eq16.png)

<br/>

For those who know this identity can now jump the next proof. We didn't learn that identity in probability theory 1.
So here it goes: The concept of this proof is based on the transformation theorem for the expectation.

<br/>

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-7-6-VAE/eq17.png)

<br/>

From Beppo Levi's theorem we know for our sequence of functions we can take the integral before the limit and then by 
taking the limit over these sequence of elementary functions and again applying Beppo Levi we will get our identity:

<br/>

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-7-6-VAE/eq18.png)

<br/>

Due to the linearity of the expectation we simply multiply it by -1 to obtain -f(z) = log(``p(x|z)``).

<br/>

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/separator.png)

<br/>

{% include chapter.html name="Monte Carlo Estimator" %}

<br/>

{% include highlights.html 
content_txt="
The basic /c/Monte Carlo Estimate approximates the transformed expectation/c/. We are interested in such approximations when 
this **expectation is intractable** to compute exactly as it is in our case. There are also other approximations like Markov Chain EM 
but this method requires repeated sampling and for large datasets this becomes very quickly inefficient.

We want to use this estimate of our reparameterized expectation:

However, /c/reparameterization is not as generic as BBVI/c/. It is typically used with Gaussian variational distributions and does not easily generalize to
other common distributions, such as the **Gamma or Beta**, without using further approximations.

The requirements to apply G-REP are:

- sampling from ``q(z|x)`` can be done efficiently
- ``q(z|x)`` is differentiable w.r.t. z and Ψ.

Applying their generalized version yields a transformation that makes p(ε) independent of Ψ in at least its first moment.

{% include highlights.html

<br/>

In the next section I will show you the BBVI gradient and the reparameterized gradient in comparison. Afterward I will show 
you how the G-REP contains both terms. For simplicity, I reduce the case to the unconditional distribution.

<br/>

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-7-6-VAE/eq22.png)

<br/>

Coming back to the G-REP method it is represented by the following terms:

<br>

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-7-6-VAE/eq23.png)

<br/>

By some restructuring of our objective we can derive them as a sum: 

<br/>

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-7-6-VAE/eq24.png)

<br/>

In the next section I show you how you can retrieve the BBVI gradient as well as the gradient of the reparameterized expectation:

<br/>

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-7-6-VAE/eq25.png)

<br/>

Due to the first property we can obtain the gradient of the reparameterized expectation.
The latter property shows that we can retrieve the BBVI gradient when we choose T to be the identity.
