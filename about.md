As a mathematics student and programmer I enjoy learning new concepts in mathematics, visualize them and see how they can be applied in computer science. 
The purpose of this blog is to summarize some of these concepts and make them more understandable or show a different perspective on them. 

<br/>My main interests are topology, complex analysis, differential geometry, non-linear optimization, statistics and machine learning.
If you have any suggestion about a topic you want me to explain in an article then just send me a mail. 

<br/> To help my blog grow I would appreciate if you share my posts.
