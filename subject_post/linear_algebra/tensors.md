#### Introduction

<br>

### Relation to contravariant - and covariant vectors

<br/>

1. contravariant : coordinate transformation (B^-1 )^T, where B is matrix w/ basis vector columns
2. same behavior as coordinates of a gradient - look representation (higher dim. differential calculus in Ana2)
3. reason : such a gradient is the difference of the function per unit distance in
the direction of the basis vector
4. covariant vector: a gradient 
5. reason: it transforms in the same way as the basis vector columns

transformation and on the right the basis transformation. In the center of both plots you can see the unit disc:
$$\{ v \in \mathbb{R}^{2} : \| v \|_2 \leq 1 \}$$ As we can see these transformations are acting inverse to each other."%}
