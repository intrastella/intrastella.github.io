## Transformation Matrix

### Change of basis and coordinate transformation

<br/>

#### Definitions

<br>

#### Relation to contravariant - and covariant vectors

<br/>

1. contravariant : coordinate transformation (B^-1 )^T, where B is matrix w/ basis vector columns
2. same behavior as coordinates of a gradient - look representation (higher dim. differential calculus in Ana2)
3. reason : such a gradient is the difference of the function per unit distance in
the direction of the basis vector
4. covariant vector: a gradient 
5. reason: it transforms in the same way as the basis vector columns
